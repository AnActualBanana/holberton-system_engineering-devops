# Looping and Conditional Statements in Shell Scripts  

## Overview  
This project explores loops and conditional statements in shell scripting. The provided scripts demonstrate how to use `for`, `while`, and `until` loops, as well as conditional statements, to control program flow in a Unix-like shell environment.  

## Files and Scripts  

| Script/File                          | Description  |  
|--------------------------------------|-------------|  
| `1-for_best_school`                 | Uses a `for` loop to print a specific message multiple times.  |  
| `2-while_best_school`               | Uses a `while` loop to print a message repeatedly.  |  
| `3-until_best_school`               | Uses an `until` loop to print a message until a condition is met.  |  
| `4-if_9_say_hi`                     | Checks if a number is 9 and prints "Hi" if true.  |  
| `5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance`     | Implements conditional logic for handling specific numbers.  |  
| `6-superstitious_numbers`           | Uses conditional statements to associate meanings with certain numbers.  |  
| `7-clock`                           | Simulates a simple clock using loops.  |  
| `8-for_ls`                          | Uses a `for` loop to list files in a directory.  |  
| `9-to_file_or_not_to_file`          | Checks for the existence of a file and performs an action accordingly.  |  
| `10-fizzbuzz`                       | Implements the classic FizzBuzz challenge using a loop.  |  

## Usage  
To run any of the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:  
```bash  
./script_name  
```
Make sure the script has execution permissions:  
```bash  
chmod +x script_name  
```
