# Process Management in Shell Scripts  

## Overview  
This project explores process management in Unix-like operating systems using shell scripts. The scripts demonstrate how to retrieve process IDs (PIDs), list running processes, manage background jobs, and terminate processes using different commands.  

## Files and Scripts  

| Script/File                          | Description  |  
|--------------------------------------|-------------|  
| `0-what-is-my-pid`                  | Displays the process ID (PID) of the current shell session.  |  
| `1-list_your_processes`              | Lists all currently running processes.  |  
| `2-show_your_bash_pid`               | Finds and displays the PID of the Bash process.  |  
| `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`     | An alternative way to retrieve the Bash PID.  |  
| `4-to_infinity_and_beyond`           | Runs an infinite loop displaying messages continuously.  |  
| `5-dont_stop_me_now`                 | Runs a background process that cannot be stopped using `Ctrl+C`.  |  
| `6-stop_me_if_you_can`               | Starts a process that can be stopped only under specific conditions.  |  
| `7-highlander`                       | Ensures that only one instance of a specific process runs at a time.  |  
| `8-beheaded_process`                 | Demonstrates how to send signals to terminate or control processes.  |  

## Usage  
To run any of the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:  
```bash  
./script_name  
```
Make sure the script has execution permissions:  
```bash  
chmod +x script_name  
```
