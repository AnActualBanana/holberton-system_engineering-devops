# Networking Basics  

## Overview  
This project explores fundamental networking concepts, including the OSI model, types of networks, IP and MAC addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, and port numbers. The scripts provide hands-on demonstrations of these concepts and include utilities for checking network connectivity.  

## Files and Scripts  

| Script/File                        | Description  |  
|------------------------------------|-------------|  
| `0-OSI_model`                      | Explains the OSI model and its seven layers. (Answer to a quiz question)  |  
| `1-types_of_network`                | Describes different types of networks (LAN, WAN, etc.). (Answer to a quiz question)  |  
| `2-MAC_and_IP_address`              | Explains MAC and IP addresses and their roles in networking. (Answer to a quiz question)  |  
| `3-UDP_and_TCP`                     | Compares the UDP and TCP protocols. (Answer to a quiz question)  |  
| `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`               | Displays listening ports, showing listening sockets and the PID of each program to which each socket belongs  |  
| `5-is_the_host_on_the_network`      | # Pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times. |  

## Usage  
To run any of the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:  
```bash  
./script_name  
```
Make sure the script has execution permissions:  
```bash  
chmod +x script_name  
```
